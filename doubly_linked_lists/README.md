#C - Doubly linked lists


##General Information
Doubly Linked List: A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains an integer value (n) and two pointers:

-prev points to the previous node.

-next points to the next node.

Usage: You need to implement and manipulate a doubly linked list in various ways, including adding nodes, printing, deleting, etc.

##Requirements
Editors: You are allowed to use editors like vi, vim, or emacs.

Compilation: Code should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.

File Endings: All files must end with a new line.

Style: Code must follow the Betty style guide.

Prototypes: All function prototypes must be in the header file (lists.h), which should be included and guarded.

##Task Overview
Print List: Implement a function to print all elements of a doubly linked list.

List Length: Write a function to count the number of nodes in a doubly linked list.

Add Node (Beginning): Add a new node at the start of the list.

Add Node (End): Add a new node at the end of the list.

Free List: Implement a function to free all nodes in the list.

Get Node at Index: Return the node at a specified index in the list.

Sum List: Calculate and return the sum of all integers in the list.

Insert at Index: Insert a new node at a given position (index).

Delete at Index: Delete a node at a specific index.

##Implementation Guidelines
Prototypes: Function prototypes are to be declared in lists.h.

Memory Allocation: Only malloc, free, printf, and exit from the C standard library are allowed.

Functions: Each C file should contain no more than five functions.
