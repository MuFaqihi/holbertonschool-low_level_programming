C - Pointers, arrays and strings

C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
0. memset
Project Overview
This project implements a custom version of the memset function,
which fills a specified memory area with a constant byte value. It helps understand low-level memory manipulation in C.
The _memset function takes three parameters:

s: Pointer to the memory area.
b: The byte value to fill.
n: Number of bytes to fill.

1. memcpy
##Project Overview
This project involves implementing a custom version of the memcpy function, 
which copies a specified number of bytes from one memory area to another. It helps understand how memory copying works in C
##Description:
The function copies n bytes from the memory area pointed to by src to the memory area pointed to by dest.

##Parameters:

dest: The destination memory area where the bytes will be copied to.
src: The source memory area from where the bytes will be copied.
n: The number of bytes to copy.
Return: It returns a pointer to the destination memory area dest.

# 2. strchr

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing low-level functions in C. It demonstrates basic concepts such as memory manipulation, string manipulation, and function pointers.

## Functions Implemented
- `_strchr`: Locates a character in a string.
- `_memset`: Fills memory with a constant byte.
- `_memcpy`: Copies memory area.
- `_strspn`: Finds the length of a prefix substring.
